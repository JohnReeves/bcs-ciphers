# Ciphr-Solvr: Your cipher solver

## 1. A Minimal Viable Product

You have learned how to:    
* make an HTML form to input and output text   
* use CSS to style the form and give feedback to the user   
* include the JQuery library into your project    
* use JavaScript to read text and change the letters  
* join the HTML form to the JavaScript functions   

Now you can:
* add more ciphers and deciphering tools    
* make the form even more beautiful    
* make it robust against people doing silly things.

`Pro-Tip` Don't add everything at once and share your ideas :-)
