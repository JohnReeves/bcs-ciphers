Cipher means secret in Classical Greek and Latin.
 
Cipher can also be spelt with a ‘y’, as ‘cypher’, this is because the ‘ie’ sound was 
written with the greek letter upsilon that looks like a ‘y’ which didn’t exist in the Latin alphabet.
 
People in the olden days who had secrets were generally well educated people who could write in Latin and Greek.
 
A good place to start with ciphers are:
 
* Caesar Cipher – a simple shift cipher   
* Vigener Cipher – shifting with a key word   
* Book Cipher – shifting with an unknown alphabet   

## 1. Encoding is easy, decoding is hard

The idea with enciphering, is to make it hard to decode.

* The Caesar is the easiest to decode, with only 26 possibilities for your decoded phrase   
* The Vigener Cipher is immediately very much harder because the key word could be any length   

Imagine how much harder the messages are to decode, if you have to find the alphabet and the keyword, and a randomised mathematical function that is shuffling everything up.   

This is when solving cypher puzzles become an art!

## 2. Simple Caesar, or shift, Cipher

The Caesar Cipher encodes a word by changing each letter by a fixed amount in the alphabet.

Apparently it was used by the Romans to send secret messages, and probably only worked at 
a time when most people didn't read or if you can't speak Latin!

It's a easy place to start with ciphers, and you can program it in JavaScript or Python.

Encoding and decoding are just opposites.

## 3. Simple Book Cipher

The Book Cipher has lots of different names and extends the Caesar Cipher by shifting against a different alphabet.

## 4. Polyalphabetic Cipher

Using a randomised alphabet makes the encoding even harder to crack.
